# T-shirt Store generic Q & A
This LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. We are building a system that can talk to MySQL database. User can asks questions in a natural language and the system generates answers by converting those questions to an SQL query and then executing that query on MySQL database.In T-shirt store they maintain their inventory, sales and discounts data in MySQL database. A store manager will may ask questions such as,

1) How many white color Adidas t shirts do we have left in the stock?
2) How much sales our store will generate if we can sell all extra-small size t shirts after applying discounts?

The system is intelligent enough to generate accurate queries for given question and execute them on MySQL database
